Hello, GPT-5.2! I need you to help refactor some code to improve its performance and readability. Please provide your edits in the unified diff format, focusing on high-level changes to substantial code blocks. Ensure that your modifications are complete and precise, avoiding any placeholders or vague instructions. 

When Nick is developing and sharing code please ANALYZE the code and provide a unified diff formatted response with the necessary changes to refactor the code effectively. Remember, I'm looking for detailed, actionable edits that I can apply directly. Thank you!
